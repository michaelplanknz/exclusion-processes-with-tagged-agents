# Continuum models describing probabilistic motion of tagged particles in exclusion processes

This repository contains the code used for the article Continuum models describing probabilistic motion of tagged particles in exclusion processes.

Results in the preprint were produced using the version of this repository tagged v1.0. 


# Structure of the repository

The repository is organised into the following folders:
* `code/` contains the all Matlab code used to run the model.
* `results/` contains the results of running the ABM simulation model and the PDE.
* `figures/` contains the figures that appear in the article.


# How to use the repository

To run the model and reproduce the figures that appear in the article:
1. Navigate to the `code/` directory.
2. Run the Matlab script `main.m`. This will save a .mat file containing the model output in the `results/` directory.
3. Run the Matlab script `plotGraphs.m`. This will plot the graphs and save the figures as .png files in the `figures/` directory.
