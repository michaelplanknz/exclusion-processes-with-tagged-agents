function simResults = runOneSim(par)

% Function to run one realisation of the ABM
%
% USAGE: simResults = runOneSim(par)
%
% INPUTS: par - structure of model parameters as defined in main
%
% OUTPUTS: simResults - structure containing the following fields
%          simResults.U - row vector containing the agent count in each lattice column at simulation end
%          simResults.P - array whose (i,j) element contains the count of
%          tagged agents from tag set j in lattice column i
%          simResults.nAgents - row vector containing the total agent count at each time step
%          simResults.xTagged - array whose (i,j,k) element is the location
%          of the jth tagged agent in the ith tag set at time point k
